# Food Delivery Cost and Profit Analysis

## Project Overview

This project, **"Food Delivery Cost and Profit Analysis,"** focuses on analyzing the cost structure and profit margins in the food delivery business. Using Python, along with data manipulation and visualization libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, this analysis aims to provide insights into how different factors such as commission rates, discounts, and delivery costs influence the overall profitability. The project also introduces new columns such as **Total Cost, Effective Commission Percentage,** and **Effective Discount Percentage** to refine the cost and profit analysis.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to help food delivery companies optimize their costs and pricing strategies. By calculating the impact of key metrics like commissions, discounts, and total delivery costs, the analysis suggests ways to improve profitability. Additionally, this project introduces strategies to adjust the commission and discount structures to create new **effective values** that are aimed at increasing the overall profit margins.

## Features

- **Data Manipulation**: Using Pandas to preprocess the dataset, clean data, and perform transformations.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creation of new columns such as:
  - **Total Cost**: The overall cost incurred for the delivery of a food item (e.g., product cost, delivery cost, and any other related expenses).
  - **Effective Commission Percentage**: The adjusted commission percentage after considering discounts and other incentives given to restaurants or customers.
  - **Effective Discount Percentage**: The final discount percentage applied after any other promotional discounts are factored in.
- **Profit Calculation**: Adjusting the **Effective Commission** and **Effective Discount** values to ensure the business maintains profitability.
- **Visualization**: Using Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize key metrics, such as:
  - Impact of commission and discounts on profit margins
  - Trend analysis of total cost and profit over time

## Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for data analysis
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and feature engineering
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization for static plots
- **Seaborn**: Advanced data visualization for insightful trends and patterns

## Key Insights

- **Profit Optimization**: The analysis reveals that adjusting the **Effective Commission Percentage** and **Effective Discount Percentage** has a significant impact on profit margins. 
- **Cost Breakdown**: By breaking down the **Total Cost**, companies can identify areas where cost-saving measures can be implemented, such as renegotiating delivery fees or adjusting product pricing.
- **Commission and Discount Adjustments**: The project suggests ways to recalibrate commission rates and discounts to strike a balance between customer satisfaction and company profitability.



## Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights into cost optimization and profitability strategies for the food delivery business. By analyzing key metrics and using feature engineering techniques, the analysis helps businesses make informed decisions about commissions, discounts, and overall cost structures.
